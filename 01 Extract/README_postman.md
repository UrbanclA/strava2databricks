# Postman collection is synced to this GitHub repository.
To-be-added are some notes and how I managed to create a working restAPI configuration, however it still isn´t smooth, which I have to tend to.

At least all changes I make in Postman collection are synced automatically in the [postman.json file](/Workspace/Users/amadej.urbancl@gmail.com/Strava_ETL/strava2databricks/01 Extract/postman.json), which can hopefully make some sense to you, the reader :D 

## For import-related notebooks
Go to [02 Transform](/Workspace/Users/amadej.urbancl@gmail.com/Strava_ETL/strava2databricks/02 Transform)

Feel free to reach out for any questions!
